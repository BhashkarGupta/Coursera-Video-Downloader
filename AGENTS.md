## Project Overview

This repository is a simple Chrome Extension for Coursera users. It downloads:
- Videos (with subtitles)
- PDF readings (page content)

The project is intentionally small and should stay simple.

## Current State

- Uses `pnpm` for package management
- Has a simple build system (`scripts/build.js`) that creates a `dist/` folder
- Dependencies are managed via `package.json` (e.g., `html2pdf.js`)
- Extension is built and loaded from the `dist/` folder

## Development Workflow

1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Build the extension: `pnpm build` (creates `dist/` folder)
3. Load the `dist/` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome

## Scope and Principles

- Keep the extension lightweight and easy to understand.
- Avoid complex build tooling unless it clearly improves maintainability.
- Prefer plain JS and minimal dependencies.

## File Layout (Key Files)

- `package.json` - dependencies and scripts
- `scripts/build.js` - build script that copies files to `dist/`
- `manifest.json` - Chrome Extension manifest
- `background.js` - background logic
- `content.js` - content script logic
- `popup.html` / `popup.js` - UI
- `dist/` - built extension (generated by build script)
  - `html2pdf.bundle.min.js` - copied from `node_modules` during build

## Contribution Notes

- Prefer minimal changes that keep the project approachable.
- Build and dev workflow is documented in `README.md`.
- Keep new dependencies small and justified.
